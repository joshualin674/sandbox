          <h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
          <p>
            The student architect exists in a precursory realm to that of architectural practice.
            Often exempt from the boundary of the “realistic,” the limits of creation become those
            of one’s imagination. Limitless creation - testing, adapting, and subsequent learning
            without risk of failure. The student architects build in a sandbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sandbox is a student-sourced and operated architectural publication providing a
            platform for emerging student perspectives and explorations. Deepened through
            guidance from faculty advisors, it dismantles the notion that a developing
            architectural voice is one unworthy of broadcast, creating exploratory amateur
            architectural discourse in the present, as well as a referential future time
            capsule of frozen moments in constantly evolving architectural careers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Written, designed, compiled, and edited by students from the School of Architecture,
            Sandbox releases works digitally through semester-long thematic issue cycles with a
            limited print format release to end each. Content within issues includes but is not
            limited to written, audio, and visual media, practitioner interviews, and student
            work, produced both in-house and from open calls-for-submissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through recognizing the significance within sufficiency, Sandbox strives to add the
            diverse, undomesticated voice of the student to the conversation of architecture.

            Sandbox calls upon students, educators, designers, artists, and practitioners as both
            recipients and contributors in an open and equal discourse. Submissions from outside
            the Georgia Tech School of Architecture are welcomed and encouraged, further
            broadening the scope of discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Sandbox heavily emphasizes the role of the student as both a key
            contributor and consumer: The student plays a key role in diversifying the
            individuals that comprise architectural/design discourse. Sandbox facilitates discourse
            between all designers and artists regardless of title, professional experience, or grade
            level.

          <p>
            As the primary interface, the SANDBOX website will allow for a place to publish and
            display work. The website houses new releases in full, as well as an archive of all
            prior issues/works. This digital format will ensure that students and faculty have easy
            access and clear direction when trying to find articles and/or other work.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the secondary interface, Instagram (@sandbox.gt) will act as the main link between
            the publication and student body. Here we will release issue-specific abstracts/calls
            for submission at the beginning of each issue cycle, post updates, graphics, and
            snippets of work.
